                      My mom gave me this tradition Japanese snack. The Japanese
                      snack is quite funny for me. They are not specially tasty
                      but you will keep non-stop eating it. So, I tried to
                      introduce these 10 kinds of snack.

                      First, soak the dried mushroom and cheery fungus into the
                      water until it is soft. Peel the potatoes and cut into
                      strips. Squeeze out the water from soften mushroom and
                      then remove the stem and cut into strips.

                      Every year, my parents come to Germany and visit their
                      grandchild (yes, not me). Every time, my mom bought a log
                      of herbs, Asian ingredients, snacks, etc., to us
                      (actually, just me to tough it. My kid and husband don’t
                      like these kinds of Asian foods.) So, I have a lot of
                      mushrooms, a lot of herbal tea, a lot of a lot of a lot of
                      something I never ever can finish it alone. Last weekend,
                      I tried to clean up the storage room. I found some dried
                      mushroom and million thousand of cherry fungus. I made a
                      promise to myself that I have to finish all these cherry
                      fungus. So, this [Stir Fried Three Vegetables] is
                      born.Ingredients

                      To make the food more fun for my kid, I bought this mold
                      from 10 dollar shop in Hong Kong (10 dollar means 10 Hong
                      Kong dollar. Less than 1 Euro).

                      I like to watch Korean variety shows such as [Boss in the

                      youtube channel such as [Wassup Man], [YangBoss MakTube],
                      etc. They show this Korean fried chicken from time to
                      time. Living in Germany is not easy to find Korean food. I
                      decided to make my own one.

                      I have some leftover during the lunch time. So, I only
                      used half cauliflower.First of all, I boiled the
                      cauliflower in the salty water until it is soft. There are
                      some inside leaves from cauliflower. It also tastes good
                      by boiling it or stir frying it. The outside one is the
                      harder one. I keep them for guinea pigs. After boiling the
                      cauliflower, let it cool down and then you can start to
                      make the coating. Dip the cauliflower into flour, then egg
                      wash and then breadcrumb. After it, put it into the hot
                      oil and deep fry until crispy. Nothing fancy but tasty.

                      may not find Slovak food easily. Then, my husband taught
                      (a.k.a forced) me to learn. Fried Cauliflower (Slovak
                      name: Vyprážaný Karfiol) is one of popular dish in
                      Slovakia if you eat outside. Below is my version.

                      Chenpi is a sun-dried tangerine peel. In Hong Kong, it
                      uses on different dishes such as red bean soup, congee,
                      steam fish, fish ball or just put into a hot water like
                      tea. Surely you can find it in the Asian store. But you
                      have no idea what chemical stuff it added on the peel… and
                      the good quality and few-year-sun-tried chenpi is very
                      expensive. So I decided to prepare my own chenpi.

                    <p>
                      Actually it is not so messy. Just peel off the skin of
                      tangerine and remove stem and the white “meat” (albedo) as
                      much as possible by a knife. Then dry under the sun for 3
                      days. After it, you can store it into tight seal glass and
                      keep it in cool area. Every year, you just need to put
                      under the sun for a while and then you can keep very long
                      time…

                    <blockquote>
                      According to some websites, if the sun-dried tangerine
                      peel is called chenpi, it needs to dry minimum 3 years. If
                      not, it only can be called sun-dried peel… so, I tried but
                      it still has 154 weeks to go….
